# This-Is-Jeopardy! Workthrough
This repository contains my solution code for the Jeopardy Codecademy project. To run the solution code locally, clone the repository and run the following commands in a BASH terminal:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

NOTE: If you already have Jupyter Notebooks installed, you will not need to run this command. The first python widget of the notebook will install all the neccesary libraries. It is also reccomended that you work in a virtual environment for this notebook, but it is not required.
